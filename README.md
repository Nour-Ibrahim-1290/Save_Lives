Blood Donation Platform - To connect the ones in need with the ones who are ready to help
> Note, This is an MVP and you could consider this is v1.0 and there are upcoming versions later.

## Description

This platform serves as a pivotal channel connecting individuals who are eager and altruistically inclined to donate blood with those who are in critical need of it. Our primary objective is to ensure the seamless usability of this platform. Upon visiting the website, users are encouraged to register their information, with a particular emphasis on specifying their blood type. This data is securely stored and readily accessible in the event of an emergency requiring a blood donation. Conversely, individuals in need of a specific blood type can also register their details to establish credibility and conduct targeted searches. Once a suitable donor is identified, pertinent contact information is provided, facilitating direct communication via phone call or messaging services.
